## Description

Imagine you are about to die, and your life flashes by in an instant. Feel that intensely painful realization that things could have gone better had you acted differently. Aneroe is about an apothecary who finds himself in this situation. On his deathbed, he searches for an antidote to cure his terminal illness. In a last-ditch effort to find the cure, something goes awry and he gains the ability to control his body at two different points of time in the past.

He isnâ€™t time traveling with his sick body. His mind is switching back and forth between his bodies at two different points in time. An action in the earlier setting will directly affect the later setting. In addition, any action in the earlier setting that would create a paradox results in spontaneous combustion.

The world has changed a great deal between the two past timelines.  The apothecary will need to work together with himself in order to overcome the challenging obstacles he is presented with, concoct the antidote, and prevent his untimely demise.
